Firstly, there is an NTP request being broadcasted from 192.168.1.10, which could be part of a network time synchronization process, but if unexpected, it might indicate a misconfiguration or an attempt to amplify traffic. Secondly, a TCP SYN packet from an external IP (203.0.113.5) to an internal server (192.168.1.15) on port 8080 suggests a possible scanning or probing activity. The subsequent ICMP Echo Reply from the internal server to the same external IP could indicate a response to a ping request, which might be used to map the network. Additionally, there is a failed SSH login attempt for an invalid user 'admin' from the same external IP, which is a common sign of a brute force attack. Lastly, the SSL handshake failure on the internal server's HTTP service could indicate a misconfiguration or an attempted man-in-the-middle attack. These activities warrant further investigation to ensure network security."

The SSH login attempts, in particular, are a potential security issue, suggesting a possible brute-force attack. Monitoring and further investigation are advised to confirm if this is malicious behavior."

Further, an SMTP packet shows that an email was sent to an external server 8.8.8.8, followed by a syslog warning of unusual outbound traffic.

The TCP packet from 172.16.0.5 to 10.0.0.23 on port 22 indicates an SSH connection attempt, which correlates with the syslog warning about an invalid user 'admin' attempt from the same IP address. This could be an indication of a brute-force attempt or unauthorized access attempt.

The server immediately resets this connection, probably due to security settings to prevent unauthorized access. Subsequently, the server's firewall blocked the offending IP, which is logged by the 'firewalld' service. Shortly after, there was an ICMP echo request (ping) from a neighboring IP (203.0.113.50) suggesting that the attacker might be probing the network to test for live hosts possibly after the initial address was blocked. The final syslog entry shows that server01's security policy was updated to block the entire suspicious IP range 203.0.113.0/24, indicating a proactive security measure to prevent further intrusion attempts. This sequence of events shows a typical reconnaissance and unauthorized access attempt, and the server's swift response to block the IP range appears to mitigate the threat."

This suggests the initiation of a secure web session likely to fetch or interact with resources on a web server. Next, the syslog entries indicate a failed SSH authentication attempt to login as 'root' from IP 192.168.0.104, which is a security event that could signify a brute-force attack or unauthorized access attempt. Following this, a DNS query was made from internal IP 192.168.0.10 to Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8) requesting translations for 'example.com', which appears customary for domain resolution. Subsequently, an nginx server handled a successful HTTP GET request for '/homepage.html', originating from the same source IP as the HTTPS session, confirming expected web traffic. Finally, a MySQL database error log signifies a failed login attempt by user 'admin', possibly due to incorrect credentials, suggesting a configuration or user issue."

This connection was logged and permitted by the firewall at 16:45:13. Shortly afterward, a UDP packet was received by 10.0.0.5 from the same server's port 5040, indicating a different protocol (possibly for real-time data like VoIP or streaming). By 16:45:17, the intrusion detection system flagged a warning due to an unusually high volume of traffic originating from 10.0.0.5, implying it might be participating in a high-volume data exchange or potentially being exploited for distributed services. Finally, at 16:45:19, a new TCP connection appears to be initiated from 192.168.1.20 to 10.0.0.5 on port 443, indicating another service attempt to secure a resource or service hosted on 10.0.0.5.

Furthermore, there is an attempt at an SSH connection from the network's gateway or security device (192.168.2.1) to 10.0.0.45, which fails, possibly indicating a countermeasure or an attempt to gain administrative access to investigate or halt suspicious activities. Collectively, these logs suggest that 10.0.0.45 is engaged in suspect behavior, potentially as part of a larger attack against the web server. It would be prudent to investigate the activities coming from this IP further, apply appropriate network security measures, and monitor for any ongoing security threats."

Initially, at 08:12:30, the Apache HTTP server is successfully started and ready to handle incoming connections on port 80 as logged in the syslog with an INFO level message. Shortly after, at 08:12:45, a client with IP 192.168.1.5 initiates a TCP connection to the server at 192.168.1.10, evidenced by a SYN packet targeting port 80. This is part of the standard process for starting HTTP communication. The server acknowledges the connection request with a SYN,ACK packet at 08:12:46, and the client finalizes the connection setup by sending an ACK packet at 08:12:47, thus completing the TCP three-way handshake. Soon thereafter, at 08:13:10, the server logs a WARNING about an unexpectedly high number of connection requests per second, indicating a potential overload situation possibly due to genuine traffic spikes or a deliberate act like a DDoS attack. Finally, at 08:13:12, a TCP RST packet is sent from a remote client (IP 203.0.113.45) to the server, suggesting that an existing connection was abruptly terminated from the client side, possibly due to the server's overloaded state impacting performance or connectivity issues on the client's end."

Initially, an admin account accessed system resources on 10.0.0.24 and executed SSH commands targeting the internal host at 172.16.0.10, which resulted in unauthorized configuration changes by the root user. Concurrently, a DNS query from the same source (10.0.0.24) aimed to resolve 'maliciousdomain.com', suggesting the system might be compromised. The firewall log then alerts us to suspicious traffic emanating from the internal host to an external IP (203.0.113.55), which was blocked at the firewall. Cumulatively, these logs suggest a likely compromise where the attacker utilized an admin account to execute further attacks within the network, possibly intending to exfiltrate data to a known bad actor's server. Immediate containment and investigation are advised."

The ICMP echo request to an external IP (8.8.8.8) could serve as a connectivity check, possibly part of pre-attack reconnaissance. Next, a request from 192.168.1.10 to download a script from a malicious website over HTTP was detected. Successfully accessing 'malicious-download.com' could have led to executing harmful scripts, but the access was blocked by the web filter, suggesting a potential malware infection was prevented. The sequence of events suggests a possible cyber attack leveraging compromised user credentials, with clear attempts to conduct malicious activity through privilege escalation and potential exfiltration of data via HTTP requests to known bad actors. Immediate investigation is recommended to secure the user1 account, confirm no successful root access, and verify the integrity of systems associated with 192.168.1.10."

Subsequently, a DNS query might indicate the exploration of domain information possibly related to the target network functionalities or allied entities. The TCP SYN packets sent in rapid succession to the web server, as indicated by multiple connection attempts, hint at a port scanning activity to identify open doors for potential vulnerabilities. These signs are corroborated by the syslog entries from 'nginx' and 'firewalld', indicating an attempt to connect excessively and subsequent auto-blocking due to suspicious behavior. Alert logs from the 'ids' component further confirm these activities as a scanning attempt. Therefore, this data strongly suggests that IP 192.168.10.15 was conducting a network scan, likely for reconnaissance purposes."

Secondly, the same source IP attempts an anonymous FTP login, which fails according to the syslog entry. This suggests reconnaissance or a brute-force attempt to access resources. Lastly, a suspicious HTTP GET request is observed from IP 192.168.0.200 trying to access the login page with credentials directly via the URL query string, shortly followed by a successful login alert for the user 'admin', hinting at a potential credential stuffing or previously compromised credentials.
