This is complemented by a successive and noticeably larger HTTP POST request captured at 14:07:10, indicating persistent data transfers from the same source.

To mitigate such operational issues, it is recommended to inspect and maintain the cooling systems regularly, optimize resource allocation to prevent CPU overload, and configure alerts to notify of excessive resource requests or potential hardware failures before critical shutdown scenarios occur.

The system then automatically switched to a backup DNS server (8.8.8.8), shown in the DNS resolver log. A kernel message subsequently reported that the physical link of the main interface (eth0) was down, contributing to the network disruption. The network attempted to adapt by initiating a SYN request for a DNS connection to the backup server using a different path. Probable consequences include brief interruptions in network services due to the temporary reliance on backup systems until the primary gateway is restored."

The kernel log entry at 08:10:30 indicating a CPU load average exceeding the threshold coincides with high response times reported by the HTTP server (httpd) component. This suggests that the system's processing capacity might have been temporarily overwhelmed by incoming traffic or processing demands, affecting database operations and leading to a connection timeout as seen shortly after the HTTP requests."

The final entry notes the sending of an RST, indicating a reset of the attempted connection. Syslog entries warn about these repeated attempts, suggesting either a potential configuration error on the client side or possibly an unauthorized access attempt. The repeated failure and RST packet point towards significant network or credential misconfiguration, or unauthorized probing activity."
